# Change history

## Version 0.3 - 2019-08-16
* Added code to capture SVG version of onscreen image. Opens a new browser
	window with a textarea containing the SVG code that can be cut and pasted
	into a text file and then loaded into Illustrator or Inkscape.
* Clarified distinction between the north and south pole (according to the
	IAU definition; NB the north pole is the pole that lies in the same
	hemisphere off the ecliptic as Earth's north pole) and the rotational pole
	of the planet. Added functionality to reverse the rotation rate (e.g.,
	Uranus counter-rotates relative to the pole).
* Added sprites to highlight the north and south planetographic poles.

## Version 0.2 - 2019-08-12
* Added code to visualise specific planets and specific times, with texture
	mapping and accurate orientations and rotation rates.
* Changed planetary rotation to a real-time model with a speedup factor.
* Added oblique viewing geometry option.
* Added event timings.
* Changed orbital plane rendering to a wireframe, rather than a shaded surface.
* Fixed equatorial plane flickering bug for zero obliquities.
* Added dipole offset as well as dipole orientation.

## Version 0.1 - 2019-03-23
